\begin{docsection}{Types}

Players may choose from the following types for their characters: \hyperlink{sub:soldier}{Soldier}, \hyperlink{sub:scout}{Scout}, \hyperlink{sub:scoundrel_noble}{Scoundrel or Noble}.

\subsection*{Soldier} % (fold)
\label{sub:soldier}

Soldiers combine discipline with martial skills to become the best pure warriors in the Galaxy. Soldiers can be stalwart defenders of those in need, money-seeking marauders, or brave adventurers. They can be hired guns, noble champions, or cold-hearted killers. They fight for glory, for honour, to right wrongs, to gain power, to acquire wealth,  or simply for the thrill of battle. \par

Soldiers are strong and steadfast, relying primarily on their ability to wield heavy weapons and armour due their high Might -- or alternatively a quicker resolve with medium or light weapons and high Speed. Their decent rounded stats make them the best general purpose fighters and an essential parts of any adventuring party, since few can match the consistent damage dealt by a well equipped, and motivated, soldier. 

\subsubsection*{Characteristics}
\label{subsub:soldierCharacteristics}
Most soldiers come to the profession after receiving some amount of formal training from a military organization, local militia, or private army. Some attend formal academies; others are self-taunt and well tested. A soldier may have taken up their weapon to escape a mundane life, protect a proud family traditions, or to fulfill their oath and uphold their honour. Soldiers in a particular unit share a certain camaraderie, but most have nothing in common except battle prowess and the desire to apply it to a given situation. \par

\itemLine{Individual Role} {Soldiers are physical, action-oriented people. They're more likely to overcome a challenge using hard word and perseverance as apposed to cheap tricks; they often take the most direct path towards their goal.}
\itemLine{Group Role} {Soldiers usually take and deal the most punishment in a dangerous situation. Often it falls on them to protect the other group members from threats. This sometimes means that Soldiers take on leadership roles as well, at least during combat.}
\itemLine{Societal Role} {In most cities and villages, people hold soldiers in great esteem. Although a soldier could just as likely be a thug as a noble warrior, those who help protect their fellow sentient from the dangers of apposing forces are always treated respect; or controlled by fear. There is no shame in getting paid for the use of oneâ€™s skills, so being a blade for hire is a perfectly acceptable profession.}
\itemLine{Advanced Soldiers} {As soldiers advance, their skill in battle--whether defending themselves or dishing out damage--increases to impressive levels. At higher tiers, they can often take on groups of foes by themselves or stand toe-to-toe with anyone.}

First-tier soldiers have the following abilities: \par
\itemLine{Effort} {Your Effort is 1.} 
\itemLine{Physical Nature} {You have a Might Edge
of 1 and a Speed Edge of 0, or you have a
Might Edge of 0 and a Speed Edge of 1.
Either way, you have an Intellect Edge of 0.}
\itemLine{Cypher Use} {You can bear two cyphers at a time.}
\itemLine{Martial weapon proficiency} {You can use any non-Lightsaber weapon.\enabler}
\itemLine{Starting Equipment} {Appropriate clothing, two weapons of your choice, one expensive item, two moderately priced items, and up to four inexpensive items}
\itemLine{Special Abilities} {Pick four from the abilities described below. Some
special abilities are constant, ongoing effects, and
others are specific actions that usually cost points
from one of your stat Pools. You cannot choose the same ability more than once unless specified otherwise.}
\itemAbility{Bash (1 Might point)} {This is a pummeling
melee attack. Your attack inflicts 1 less point
of damage than normal, but dazes your
target for one round, during which time the
difficulty of all tasks it performs is modified
by one step to its detriment.\action}
\itemAbility{Control the Field (1 Might point)} {This
melee attack inflicts 1 less point of damage
than normal, but regardless of whether
you hit the target, you maneuver it into a
position you desire within immediate range.\action}
\itemAbility{Extra Edge} {Your physical nature grants
you an Edge of 1 in both Speed and Might,
rather than one or the other.}
\itemAbility{Unarmed Fighter} {When you make
an unarmed attack (such as a punch or
kick), it counts as a medium weapon
instead of a light weapon.\enabler}
\itemAbility{Overwatch (1 Intellect point)} {You use
a ranged weapon to target a limited area
(such as a doorway, a hallway) and make an attack
against the next viable target to enter that
area. This works like a wait action, but you
also negate any benefit the target would
have from cover, position, surprise, range,
illumination, or visibility. Further, you inflict
1 additional point of damage with the attack.
You can remain on Overwatch as long as you
wish, within reason.\action}
\itemAbility{Physical Skill Training}{You are trained in two
skills in which you are not already trained.
Choose two of the following:\textit{balancing,
climbing, jumping, running, or swimming.}

a type of armor of your choice.\enabler}
\itemAbility{Tomahawk Toss (2 Speed points)}{After using
a thrown light weapon, you draw another
light weapon and make another thrown
attack against the same target or a different
one.\action}
\itemAbility{Weakening Strike (1 Speed point)}{This is a quick,
agile melee attack. Your attack inflicts 1 less
point of damage than normal but dazes
your target for one round, during which
time the difficulty of all tasks it performs
is modified by one step to its detriment.\action}
\itemAbility{Thrust (1 Might point)}{This is a powerful
melee stab. You make an attack and inflict 1
additional point of damage if your weapon
has a sharp edge or point.\action}
\itemAbility{Dexterous Defense}{You are trained
in Speed defense actions when not wearing
armor.\enabler}

\subsubsection*{Second-Tier Soldier}
\label{subsub:soldierSecondTier}
Choose two of the abilities described below (or from a lower tier) to add to your repertoire. In addition, you can replace one of your lower-tier abilities with a different one from a lower tier.\par
\itemAbility{Power Strike (2 Might points)}{This is a heavy,
powerful slice with a bladed weapon,
probably overhand. You must grip your
weapon with two hands to chop. When
making this attack, you take a â€“1 penalty to
the attack roll, and you inflict 3 additional
points of damage.\action}
\itemAbility{Crush (2 Might points)}{This is a powerful
pummeling attack with a bashing weapon,
probably overhand. You must grip your

attack, you take a â€“1 penalty to the attack
roll, and you inflict 3 additional points of
damage.\action}
\itemAbility{Mighty Blow (2 Might points)}{You strike
two foes with a single blow. Make separate
attack rolls for each foe, but both attacks
count as a single action in a single round.
You remain limited by the amount of Effort
you can apply on one action. Anything that
modifies your attack or damage applies to
both of these attacks.\action}
\itemAbility{Reload (1 Speed point)}{When using a
weapon that normally requires an action to
reload, such as a heavy blaster rifle, you can
reload and fire (or fire and reload) in the
same action.\enabler}
\itemAbility{Weapon Training}{Choose one type of
attack in which you are not already trained:
\textit{light bashing, light bladed, light ranged,
medium bashing, medium bladed, medium
ranged, heavy bashing, heavy bladed, 
heavy ranged}. You are trained in attacks
using that type of weapon. You can select
this ability multiple times. Each time you
select it, you must choose a different type of
attack.\enabler}

trained in \emph{defense tasks} of that type. You
can select this ability up to three times.
Each time you select it, you must choose a
different type of defense task.\enabler}
\itemAbility{Kill Zone (2 Speed points)}{If you
take down a foe, you can immediately make
another attack on that same turn against

cyphers at a time.\enabler}
\itemAbility{Reaper (3 Might points)}{For the next
minute, all melee attacks you make inflict
2 additional points of damage.\actionInit}

requires you to extend yourself for a powerful
stab or smash. The awkward lunge increases
the difficulty of the attack roll by one step.
If your attack is successful, it inflicts 4
additional points of damage.\action}
\itemAbility{Close Combat Specialist}{If a creature you attacked on
your last turn with a melee attack uses its
action to move out of immediate range, you
gain an action to attack the creature as a
parting blow, even if you have already taken
a turn in the round.\enabler}
\itemAbility{Seize the Moment (4+ Speed points)}{If you succeed on a Speed defense roll to
resist an attack, you gain an action. You can
use the action immediately even if you have

of damage than normal.\action}
\itemAbility{Rapid Fire (2 Speed points)}{If a weapon
has the ability to fire rapid shots without
reloading (usually called a rapid-fire
weapon, such as a repeater blaster), you
can spray multiple shots around your target

additional point of damage.\enabler}
\itemAbility{Armourologist}{When wearing
armor, you gain +1 to Armor.\enabler}
\itemAbility{Deceptive Strike (2 Speed points)}{If you spend one
action creating a misdirection or diversion,
in the next round you can take advantage

a melee attack roll against that opponent.
The difficulty of the roll is decreased by one
step. If your attack is successful, it inflicts 4
additional points of damage.\action}
\itemAbility{Minor to Major}{You treat rolls of natural

move, your next attack made using a melee
weapon before the end of the next round
inflicts 2 additional points of damage.\enabler}
\itemAbility{Opening Gambit (4 Might points)}{Your
melee attack shreds the defenses of a
target. Any energy-based defenses it has
(such as a force field) are
negated for 1d6 + 1 rounds. If the target
has no energy-based defenses, its Armor
is reduced by 2 for one minute. If it has
no energy-based defenses or Armor, the
difficulty of all attacks made against the
target is lowered by one step for one
minute. Lightsabers are affected for 2 turns only.\action}

next ten-hour recovery roll, the difficulty
increases by one step.\enabler}

\subsubsection*{Fifth-Tier Soldier}
\label{subsub:soldierFifthTier}
Choose three of the abilities described below (or from a lower tier) to add to your repertoire. In addition, you can replace one of your lower-tier abilities with a different one from a lower tier.\par
\itemAbility{Adroit Cypher Use}{You can bear four
cyphers at a time.\enabler}
\itemAbility{Arc Spray (3 Speed points)}{If a weapon
has the ability to fire rapid shots without
reloading (usually called a rapid-fire
weapon, such as a repeater blaster), you
can fire your weapon at up to three targets
(all next to one another) at once. Make a
separate attack roll against each target. The
difficulty of each attack is increased by one
step.\action}
\itemAbility{Attack Mastery}{Choose one
type of attack, even one in which you are
already trained: \textit{light bashing, light bladed,
light ranged, medium bashing, medium
bladed, medium ranged, heavy bashing,
heavy bladed, heavy ranged.} You are
trained in attacks using that type of weapon.
If youâ€™re already trained in that type of
attack, you instead are specialized in that
type of attack.\enabler}
\itemAbility{Improved Success}{When you roll a 17 or
higher on an attack roll that deals damage,
you deal 1 additional point of damage. For
instance, if you roll a natural 18, which
normally deals 2 extra points of damage,
you deal 3 extra points instead. If you roll
a natural 20 and choose to deal damage
instead of achieve a special major effect,
you deal 5 extra points of damage.\enabler}
\itemAbility{Hi-Jump Attack (5 Might points)}{You attempt
a difficulty 4 Might action to jump high into
the air as part of your melee attack. If you
succeed, your attack inflicts 3 additional
points of damage and knocks the foe down.
If you fail, you still make your normal attack
roll, but you donâ€™t inflict the extra damage or
knock down the opponent if you hit.\action}
\itemAbility{Armor Mastery}{The cost reduction
from your Armor Proficiency ability
improves. When you wear any armor, you
reduce the armorâ€™s Speed cost to 0. If you
select this ability and you already have the
Armor Expertise ability, replace
Armor Expertise with a different
third-tier ability because Armor Mastery is better.\enabler}
\itemAbility{Defense Mastery}{Choose one
type of defense task in which you are
trained: \textit{Might, Speed, Intellect}. You are
specialized in defense tasks of that type.
You can select this ability up to three times.
Each time you select it, you must choose a
different type of defense task.\enabler}
\itemAbility{Parry (5 Speed points)}{You can deflect
incoming attacks quickly. For the next ten
rounds, the difficulty of all Speed defense
rolls is reduced by one step.\enabler}

\subsubsection*{Sixth-Tier Soldier}
\label{subsub:soldierSixthTier}
Choose two of the abilities described below (or from a lower tier) to add to your repertoire. In addition, you can replace one of your lower-tier abilities with a different one from a lower tier.\par
\itemAbility{Coup de Grace (5 Might points)}{If your
foe is prone, stunned, or somehow helpless
or incapacitated when you strike, you
inflict 8 additional points of damage on a
successful hit.\enabler}
\itemAbility{Magnificent Moment}{If you make an
attack or attempt a task with the immediate
action you gain by using Seize the Moment,
the difficulty is reduced by one step.\enabler}
\itemAbility{High Noon (5 Speed points)}{You
stand still and make ranged attacks against
up to five foes within range, all as part
of the same action in one round. Make a
separate attack roll for each foe. You remain
limited by the amount of Effort you can
apply on one action. Anything that modifies
your attack or damage applies to all of these
attacks.\action}
\itemAbility{Slayer (3 Might points)}{When you
successfully strike a foe of level 5 or lower,
make another roll (using whichever stat
you used to attack). If you succeed on the
second roll, you kill the target outright. If
you use this ability against a PC of any tier
and you succeed on the second roll, the
character moves down one step on the
damage track.\enabler}
\itemAbility{Blade Storm (5 Speed points)}{You stand
still and make melee attacks against up
to five foes within reach, all as part of the
same action in one round. Make a separate
attack roll for each foe. You remain limited
by the amount of Effort you can apply on
one action. Anything that modifies your
attack or damage applies to all of these
attacks.\action}
\itemAbility{Weapon and Body (5 Speed points)}{After making a melee weapon or ranged
weapon attack, you follow up with a punch
or kick as an additional attack, all as part
of the same action in one round. The two
attacks can be directed at different foes. Make a separate attack roll for each attack.
You remain limited by the amount of Effort
you can apply on one action. Anything that
modifies your attack or damage applies to
both attacks, unless it is tied specifically to
your weapon.\action}

\subsection*{Scout} % (fold)
\label{sub:scout}
Scouts are natural explorers and adventurers, full of curiosity and trained to handle out-of-the-way locations where they often operate. Scouts tend to be independent, signing on when the credits are good and their skills are best utilized and tested. Scouts understand the lay of the land and the orbit of the stars. They know how to recognize danger and locate basic necessities for survival. The scout seeks knowledge, tries to solve mysteries, and wants to be the first to see something new. The scout learns to find a path through the wild regions, often becoming a decent pilot along the way, and usually learns how to protect themselves from whatever hides over the next hill or beyond the most distant nebula. \par

Scouts temper insatiable curiosity with excellent survival instincts. They make use of Speed and own experience to spot and avoid dangers. The scout has an undying faith in themselves and their abilities that sometimes allows the scout to call upon reserves and inner strength to get out of tough situations. Scouts like to be the first to reach any location, although they also want to reach it in one piece. They can be gruff or silent, jovial or talkative. They are confident and brave, and they often appreciate the wonders that the galaxy has to offer.

\subsubsection*{Characteristics}
\label{subsub:scoutCharacteristics}
Scouts come to their profession in search of something, usually knowledge or secrets or answers to the mysteries of the ages. Scholars, while possibly associated with and institute of learning or particular government, often forsake the halls of academia for the pure research of working in the field. Pathfinders and explorers may work for a government or military institutions, or freelance contracts from anyone willing to pay for their services. Many scouts develop into bounty hunters, especially those who combine military skills with their tracking and searching abilities. Every group of adventurers benefit from having a scout in the party.\par

\itemLine{Individual Role} {Although scouts can be academics or well studied, they are first and foremost interested in action. They face grave dangers and terrible obstacles as a routine part of life.}
\itemLine{Group Role} {Scouts sometimes work
alone, but far more often they operate in teams
with other characters. The scout frequently
leads the way, blazing the trail. However, they
also likely to stop and investigate anything
intriguing they stumble upon.}
\itemLine{Societal Role} {Scouts are remarkable in
that they can do so many different
things, and some do multiple
things. Skilled and learned scouts
who share their achievements with
others are prized members
of society, well respected for
what they know and can do.}
\itemLine{Advanced Explorers} {Higher-tier scouts
gain more skills, some combat abilities, and
a number of abilities that allow them to deal
with danger. In short, they become more
and more well-rounded, able to deal with
any challenge.}
