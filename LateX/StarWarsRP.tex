\subsection*{Soldier} % (fold)
\label{sub:soldier}

Soldiers combine discipline with martial skills to become the best pure warriors in the Galaxy. Soldiers can be stalwart defenders of those in need, money-seeking marauders, or brave adventurers. They can be hired guns, noble champions, or cold-hearted killers. They fight for glory, for honour, to right wrongs, to gain power, to acquire wealth,  or simply for the thrill of battle. \par

Soldiers are strong and steadfast, relying primarily on their ability to wield heavy weapons and armour due their high Might -- or alternatively a quicker resolve with medium or light weapons and high Speed. Their decent rounded stats make them the best general purpose fighters and an essential parts of any adventuring party, since few can match the consistent damage dealt by a well equipped, and motivated, soldier.

\subsubsection*{Characteristics}
\label{subsub:soldierCharacteristics}

Most soldiers come to the profession after receiving some amount of formal training from a military organization, local militia, or private army. Some attend formal academies; others are self-taunt and well tested. A soldier may have taken up their weapon to escape a mundane life, protect a proud family traditions, or to fulfill their oath and uphold their honour. Soldiers in a particular unit share a certain camaraderie, but most have nothing in common except battle prowess and the desire to apply it to a given situation. \par

\itemLine{Individual Role} {Soldiers are physical, action-oriented people. They're more likely to overcome a challenge using hard word and perseverance as apposed to cheap tricks; they often take the most direct path towards their goal.}

\itemLine{Group Role} {Soldiers usually take and deal the most punishment in a dangerous situation. Often it falls on them to protect the other group members from threats. This sometimes means that Soldiers take on leadership roles as well, at least during combat.}

\itemLine{Societal Role} {In most cities and villages, people hold soldiers in great esteem. Although a soldier could just as likely be a thug as a noble warrior, those who help protect their fellow sentient from the dangers of apposing forces are always treated respect; or controlled by fear. There is no shame in getting paid for the use of oneâ€™s skills, so being a blade for hire is a perfectly acceptable profession.}

\itemLine{Advanced Soldiers} {As soldiers advance, their skill in battle--whether defending themselves or dishing out damage--increases to impressive levels. At higher tiers, they can often take on groups of foes by themselves or stand toe-to-toe with anyone.}

\itemAbility{Bash (1 Might point)} {This is a pummeling melee attack. Your attack inflicts 1 less point of damage than normal, but dazes your target for one round, during which time the difficulty of all tasks it performs is modified by one step to its detriment.\action}

Further, you inflict 1 additional point of damage with the attack. You can remain on Overwatch as long as you wish, within reason.\action}

\itemAbility{Physical Skill Training}{You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained.

\itemAbility{Weakening Strike (1 Speed point)}{This is a quick, agile melee attack. Your attack inflicts 1 less point of damage than normal but dazes your target for one round, during which time the difficulty of all tasks it performs is modified by one step to its detriment.\action}

\itemAbility{Thrust (1 Might point)}{This is a powerful melee stab. You make an attack and inflict 1 additional point of damage if your weapon has a sharp edge or point.\action}

\itemAbility{Dexterous Defense}{You are trained in Speed defense actions when not wearing armor.\enabler}

\itemAbility{Armor Mastery}{The cost reduction from your Armor Proficiency ability improves. When you wear any armor, you reduce the armorâ€™s Speed cost to 0.

\subsection*{Scout} % (fold)
\label{sub:scout}

Scouts are natural explorers and adventurers, full of curiosity and trained to handle out-of-the-way locations where they often operate. Scouts tend to be independent, signing on when the credits are good and their skills are best utilized and tested. Scouts understand the lay of the land and the orbit of the stars. They know how to recognize danger and locate basic necessities for survival. The scout seeks knowledge, tries to solve mysteries, and wants to be the first to see something new. The scout learns to find a path through the wild regions, often becoming a decent pilot along the way, and usually learns how to protect themselves from whatever hides over the next hill or beyond the most distant nebula.

Scouts temper insatiable curiosity with excellent survival instincts. They make use of Speed and personal experience to spot and avoid dangers. The scout has an undying faith in themselves and their abilities that sometimes allows the scout to call upon reserves and inner strength to get out of tough situations. Scouts like to be the first to reach any location, although they also want to reach it in one piece. They can be gruff or silent, jovial or talkative. They are confident and brave, and they often appreciate the wonders that the galaxy has to offer.

\subsubsection*{Characteristics}
\label{subsub:scoutCharacteristics}

Scouts come to their profession in search of something, usually knowledge or secrets or answers to the mysteries of the ages. Scholars, while possibly associated with and institute of learning or particular government, often forsake the halls of academia for the pure research of working in the field. Pathfinders and explorers may work for a government or military institutions, or freelance contracts from anyone willing to pay for their services. Many scouts develop into bounty hunters, especially those who combine military skills with their tracking and searching abilities. Every group of adventurers benefit from having a scout in the party.

\itemLine{Individual Role} {Although scouts can be academics or well studied, they are first and foremost interested in action. They face grave dangers and terrible obstacles as a routine part of life.}

\itemLine{Group Role} {Scouts sometimes work alone, but far more often they operate in teams with other characters. The scout frequently leads the way, blazing the trail. However, they also likely to stop and investigate anything intriguing they stumble upon.}

\itemLine{Societal Role} {Scouts are remarkable in that they can do so many different things, and some do multiple things. Skilled and learned scouts who share their achievements with others are prized members of society, well respected for what they know and can do.}

\itemLine{Advanced Scouts} {Higher-tier scouts gain more skills, some combat abilities, and a number of abilities that allow them to deal with danger. In short, they become more and more well-rounded, able to deal with any challenge.}

% SCOUNDREL
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection*{Scoundrel} % (fold)
\label{sub:scoundrel}
Scoundrels are rogues--good, bad, and neutral--who either live outside the law or manipulates it to suit their needs. They can come from any world or region in the Galaxy. Most use their Intelligence and attention to detail to accomplish tasks, and many rely on their silver-tongue when all else fails. The scoundrel gets by with bravado, dunning, duplicity, and trickery. They live by their wits, manipulating others, but can fight when the need arises.\par

Many scoundrels live a life of adventure for the excitement it provides. Others go adventuring to advance their illicit careers. Some are good-hearted rogues in it for the thrill or to right a wrong done to them or those they love. Others are despicable knaves who serve only one master--the greed that swells inside them. Most often, an adventurous scoundrel falls somewhere in-between, changing allegiance and attitude as the political climate changes. The skills a scoundrel pick up along the way make them great members of any mission team.

\subsubsection*{Characteristics}
\label{subsub:scoundrelCharacteristics}
Scoundrels have a knack for getting out of trouble. They have an instinct for self-preservation that keeps them alive, but it's usually tempered with a need to experience thrills that their profession has to offer, and many adventurous scoundrels are also saddle with a sense of honour that sometimes makes them go against their natural inclinations. \par

\itemLine{Individual Role}{Scoundrels are smart and
charismatic. They like people and, more
important, they understand them. This
helps scoundrels get others to do what needs
to be done.}
\itemLine{Group Role}{The scoundrel is often the face
of the group, serving as the person who
speaks for all and negotiates with others.
Combat and action are not a scoundelâ€™s immediate resolve, so other characters sometimes
have to defend the speaker in times of
danger.}
