%Intro
\begin{docsection}{How To Play}

\subsection*{Something}

Playing Star Wars Simplified (SWS) is similar to traditional pen \& paper roleplaying games. You, the player, controls a single character

\end{docsection}

%Front matter
\begin{docsection}{Some Other Stuff}

Space to be filled with content. This should also be a multi-column page.

\end{docsection}

%Descriptors
\begin{docsection}{Descriptors}

Space to be filled with content. This should also be a multi-column page.

\end{docsection}

%Types
\begin{docsection}{Types}

Players may choose from the following types for their characters: \hyperlink{sub:soldier}{Soldier}, \hyperlink{sub:scout}{Scout}, \hyperlink{sub:scoundrel_noble}{Scoundrel or Noble}.

\subsection*{Soldier} % (fold)
\label{sub:soldier}

The general warrior.

% subsection* soldier (end)

\subsection*{Scout} % (fold)
\label{sub:scout}

The fast, typically stealthy operative.

% subsection* scout (end)

\subsection*{Scoundrel / Noble} % (fold)
\label{sub:scoundrel_noble}

The silver-tongued smuggler or diplomat.

% subsection* scoundrel_noble (end)

\end{docsection}

%Foci
\begin{docsection}{Foci}

Space to be filled with content. This should also be a multi-column page.

\end{docsection}

%The Force
\begin{docsection}{The Force}

Unlike the Star Wars Saga rule set and other homebrew systems, these rules do not restrict force sensitivity to a particular class; force sensitivity is instead treated as an additional skill tree that can be pursued by players at the DM's discretion.
