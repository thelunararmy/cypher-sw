\chapter{The Force} % (fold)
\label{cha:force}

The Force is an energy field generated by all living things. It surrounds and penetrates everything, binding the galaxy together. There are two sides to the Force. Peace, serenity, and knowledge from the light side -- aggression, anger, and fear, from the dark. The universe is a place of balance: life and death, creation and destruction, love and hate. As such, both sides of the Force are part of the natural order.

Some beings are more attuned to the Force than others. Whether they understand or not, they can feel the Force flowing through them. Of those sensitive to the Force, there are beings that study it -- learning ways to manipulate its energy. The Jedi fall into the category, using their knowledge of the Force to give them their powers. But theirs is not the only Force-using tradition. The Sith, the Nightsisters of Dathomir, and others embrace the dark side of the Force, while a variety of alien creatures call the light side of the Force by various other names.

\section{Force Sensitivity} % (fold)
\label{sec:force_sensitivity}

The Force is prevalent in all living matter; every creature is capable to unconsciously feel the Force, but it is only those who experience and become sensitive to it's nature that may actively call upon the Force for assistance. It is this Force Sensitivity that draws the distinction between the average sentient, who might simply call it luck, and those who believe in the will of the Force. The first step for a character to actively manipulate the Force, is for them to be Force Sensitive. There are many ways characters can become Force Sensitive. A character may be exposed to a fracture in the Force, experience a cataclysmic event, read a forbidden text, unlock an ancient holocron, or simply be born with it -- all of which will allow a character to be Force Sensitive. This distinction of Force Sensitivity, and its distribution, is made entirely by the GM.

% section force_sensitivity (end)

\section{Using the Force} % (fold)
\label{sec:using_the_force}

Once a character gains Force Sensitivity they gain access a new fourth pool that represents their own personal capacity to use the Force. This 4th pool, appropriately called the Force pool, is reflected by a character's connection to life and is naturally represented by the balance of their capabilities. The starting value of the Force pool is the average between Might, Speed, and Intellect (rounded down) when the character first experiences Force Sensitivity. The Force pool acts similarly to Might, Speed, and Intellect: to increase it's value the player would need to invest XP to do so, using the Force will drain points from the pool, resting will replenish the Force pool, and finally when all Force points are exhausted the character cannot call upon the Force for assistance. A character may also apply Effort when using the Force at an additional cost to their Force Pool.

% section using_the_force (end)

\subsection{Force Edge} % (fold)
\label{sub:force_edge}

When using Force points from your Force pool, your Force Edge reduces the cost of that specific action and it can also reduce the cost of applying Effort to a roll. However, Force Edge is separated into three different values that are affected by your Force Affinity (see below). These three individual Edge values are called Light Edge, Neutral Edge, and Dark Edge. Force abilities labeled as Light, Universal, or Dark, each use their corresponding Edge values to dictate how much the affected cost is changed. Unlike regular Edge values, Force Edge values can also be negative -- resulting in an increase in the Force point cost. Unlike regular Edge values, a player cannot increase any Force Edge values via spending XP and they are instead determined by the character's \hyperref[sec:force_affinity]{Force Affinity}. Once an Edge reaches +3, you can apply one level of Effort for free.

% subsection force_edge (end)

\section{Force Affinity} % (fold)
\label{sec:force_affinity}

The Force consists of two aspects, one light and one dark. The light side focuses on the positive aspects of life and thus requires strict discipline and control to enable the user to use purity of the Force. The dark side lurks in the shadows, whispering to Force-users, tempting them with quick and easy access to power -- it often displays itself as the stronger between the two sides. A character's actions will directly affect their affinity, for example saving a village and refusing reward is generally considered a light-sided act, whereas killing an innocent bystander in a fight is considered a dark-sided act. An individual's Force Affinity is classified into one of five categories: Light-sided, Light-leaning, Neutral or Gray, Dark-leaning, or Dark-sided. All characters start in the Neutral affinity classification, but should seek to branch into the respective side they wish to follow. Typically this is Light-sided for Jedi, and Dark-sided for Sith or Fallen Jedi. The corresponding Force Edge values for each affinity is outlined in the table below.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c| }
\hline
\textbf{Force Affinity} & \textbf{L-Edge} & \textbf{N-Edge} & \textbf{D-Edge} \\
\hline \hline
Light-sided 	& $+2$ 	& $+1$ 	& $-2$	\\
\hline
Light-leaning 	& $+1$ 	& $0$ 	& $-1$	\\
\hline
Neutral		 	& $0$ 	& $0$ 	& $0$ 	\\
\hline
Dark-leaning 	& $-1$ 	& $0$ 	& $+1$ 	\\
\hline
Dark-sided 		& $-2$ 	& $+1$ 	& $+2$ 	\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

% section force_affinity (end)

\subsection{Changing Affinity} % (fold)
\label{sub:changing_affinity}

It is the GM's responsibility to change a player character's affinity as they see fit. Keep in mind a character's particular motive for doing Light or Dark sided acts during the course of the game. Additionally, not all transgressions are inherently evil or bad -- accepting rewards, asking for payment, refusing to save a life (not endangered by your actions), killing evil, or looting bodies, typically will not incur a shift towards the dark side. The shift amounts for doing sided actions will differ between situations.

% subsection changing_affinity (end)

\section{The Jedi Order} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_jedi_order}

For centuries, the group of philosophers that would eventually become the Jedi contemplated the energy field as the Force. Eventually, some of the group's members mastered the Force. After that, they dedicated themselves to using their newfound powers for good, helping those in need. In the thousands of years that followed, the Jedi serves as protectors of the Galactic Republic. Answering to their own Jedi council and operating in concordance with the Judaical Department of the office of the Supreme Chancellor, the Jedi became the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy.

The Jedi, in addition to battling interstellar criminals and settling galactic disputes, served as mediators, defenders, and teachers. Because of their sense of honour and the epic challenges they undertook, the Jedi became legends, serving as symbols of the best the republic had to offer. With lightsabers at their sides and the power of the Force flowing through them, the Jedi accomplished the tasks set before them with dedication and seemingly invincibility. But invincibility as an illusion. Jedi often died in the defense of freedom and justice.

\subsection{Organisation} % (fold)
\label{sub:organisation}

The Jedi Order is administered by a number of councils with differing purposes or tasks. The primary governing body of The Jedi Order is the Jedi High Council whose task is to discuss and contemplate all aspects of The Order. Additional councils were formed to deal with aspects too specific for The High Council to properly run on top of its already broad scope. Throughout history, nearly all council members were Jedi Masters, with few exceptions.

\subsubsection{The High Council}

The High Council is comprised of twelve Jedi Masters: five permanent members who accepted a lifetime commitment to it, four long-term members who served until they chose to step down and three limited-term members who served on the council for a specified period of time. The High Council appoints its own members through unanimous vote and each council has its own designated leader who is given the title ``Master of the Order'' or ``Grand Master''.

\subsubsection{Council of First Knowledge}

The Council of First Knowledge was composed of five Jedi Masters and led by the ``Caretaker of First Knowledge''. This council is tasked with overseeing the various Jedi Academies and the curriculum of the Jedi Initiates. To this end, the council also guards and maintains the Temple Archives, holocrons and the Shadow program.

\subsubsection{Council of Reconciliation}

Seeking diplomatic resolutions to conflicts, the five members of the Council of Reconciliation dealt with the Galactic Senate and the Republic Diplomatic Corps in order to help end political standoffs. The first face of the Republic presented to worlds interested in joining the Republic, this Council would dispatch diplomats and ambassadors to moderate debate and hammer out treaties.

\subsubsection{Council of Reassignment}

The Council of Reassignment ran the Jedi Service Corps and each of its branch councils. Organizing work for those Initiates who failed out of the academy and Knights with special talents, the Reassignment Council oversaw this branch's missions and assignments.

\subsubsection{Academy Councils}

While The High Council is the primary governing body of The Jedi Order, historically the Jedi Academies scattered across the galaxy were governed by their own councils.

Examples of such councils are: the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine and the Tarisian Jedi Academy.

\subsection{Jedi Ranks} % (fold)
\label{sub:jedi_ranks}

The ranks of The Jedi Order denote the individual's standing and level of training among other Jedi. The requirements for ascending to the next rank of Jedi vary with each rank. Most Jedi begin their initiation into The Jedi Order from a very young age to remove them from the temptations of ordinary life. For this reason, starting the process of becoming a Jedi in adulthood is unheard of, with the exception of dire circumstances such as war-time or if Jedi-kind is near extinction. Below is a table of character tiers and their corresponding \textit{recommended} Jedi ranks.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c| }
\hline
\textbf{Tier} & \textbf{Rank} \\
\hline \hline
$1$   & Initiate \\
\hline
$2$   & Padawan \\
\hline
$3$   & Knight \\
\hline
$4$   & Knight \\
\hline
$5$   & Knight with Specialization \\
\hline
$6$   & Master \\
\hline
$N/A$ & Grand Master \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

These ranks are merely recommendations for GMs. Players are not automatically granted a higher rank within The Order until they are told as much by their GM.

\subsubsection{Initiate}

To become a Jedi Initiate, one must be discovered to be force sensitive by a Jedi. Typically Jedi Initiates are found from a young age and trained in the basic use of the force in large classes.

\subsubsection{Padawan}

A Jedi Initiate becomes a Padawan when they are chosen for mentorship by another Jedi Knight or higher rank. Padawans receive direct instruction from their masters and accompany them in the field for all but the most dangerous of missions.

\subsubsection{Knight}

A Jedi Padawan becomes a Knight after being recommended for the trials by their master and passing them. Although an amount of time is not explicitly specified, Jedi will spend the majority of their pre-adult lives (equivalent human teenage years) as a Padawan, until their masters deem them ready for their trials. The trials are designed to test the motives and physical and mental discipline of those that undertake them. The trials are always be prepared and administered by a Jedi Master other than their mentor and the exact nature of a trial can vary between Master and Padawan.

Jedi Knights, as fully fledged members of The Jedi Order, have responsibilities such as their own advancement, tasks given to them by the Jedi Council and training Padawans to undertake their trials. Training Padawans is typically a responsibility that is only given to a Jedi Knight after they have gained sufficient experience.

As part of their own advancement and in accordance with their own nature, a Jedi Knight may pursue certain knowledge or expertise:

\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{Jedi Guardians} hone their skill in combat and knowledge of the battlefield. These Jedi may also follow the teachings and assume the following roles within The Jedi Order: Exotic Weapon Specialist, Battle Master, Ace and Peacekeeper.
\item The \textbf{Jedi Sentinels} augment a vast skill set with the guidance and potential of the force. Equally capable with their words and their lightsabers, but not so much as the Guardians or the Consulars, they can assume a number of roles within The Jedi Order arising from their adaptive nature. Jedi Sentinels may train to become: Artisans, Investigators, Recruiters, Shadows, Temple Guards and Watchmen.
\item The \textbf{Jedi Consulars} spend the majority of their time in libraries gaining knowledge and honing their control and ability to manipulate reality through the force. Jedi Consulars may become: Ambassadors, Artisans, Diplomats, Healers, Lore Keepers, Researchers and Seers.

Players may choose from the following types for their characters: \hyperref[sub:soldier]{Soldier}, \hyperref[sub:scout]{Scout}, \hyperref[sub:scoundrel]{Scoundrel}. Players may also choose the \hyperref[sub:jedi]{Jedi} type, however this should be done in consultation with the GM.

\subsection{Soldier} % (fold)
\label{sub:soldier}

Soldiers combine discipline with martial skills to become the best pure warriors in the Galaxy. Soldiers can be stalwart defenders of those in need, money-seeking marauders, or brave adventurers. They can be hired guns, noble champions, or cold-hearted killers. They fight for glory, for honour, to right wrongs, to gain power, to acquire wealth,  or simply for the thrill of battle.

Soldiers are strong and steadfast, relying primarily on their ability to wield heavy weapons and armour due their high Might -- or alternatively a quicker resolve with medium or light weapons and high Speed. Their decent rounded stats make them the best general purpose fighters and an essential parts of any adventuring party, since few can match the consistent damage dealt by a well equipped, and motivated, soldier.

\subsubsection*{Characteristics}
\label{subsub:soldierCharacteristics}

Most soldiers come to the profession after receiving some amount of formal training from a military organization, local militia, or private army. Some attend formal academies; others are self-taunt and well tested. A soldier may have taken up their weapon to escape a mundane life, protect a proud family traditions, or to fulfill their oath and uphold their honour. Soldiers in a particular unit share a certain camaraderie, but most have nothing in common except battle prowess and the desire to apply it to a given situation.

\itemLine{Individual Role}{Soldiers are physical, action-oriented people. They're more likely to overcome a challenge using hard word and perseverance as apposed to cheap tricks; they often take the most direct path towards their goal.}

\itemLine{Group Role}{Soldiers usually take and deal the most punishment in a dangerous situation. Often it falls on them to protect the other group members from threats. This sometimes means that Soldiers take on leadership roles as well, at least during combat.}

\itemLine{Societal Role}{In most cities and villages, people hold soldiers in great esteem. Although a soldier could just as likely be a thug as a noble warrior, those who help protect their fellow sentient from the dangers of apposing forces are always treated respect; or controlled by fear. There is no shame in getting paid for the use of one’s skills, so being a blade for hire is a perfectly acceptable profession.}

\itemLine{Advanced Soldiers}{As soldiers advance, their skill in battle--whether defending themselves or dishing out damage--increases to impressive levels. At higher tiers, they can often take on groups of foes by themselves or stand toe-to-toe with anyone.}

\subsubsection*{First-Tier Soldier}
\label{subsub:soldierFirstTier}

First-tier soldiers have the following abilities:

\itemLine{Effort}{Your Effort is 1.}

\itemLine{Physical Nature}{You have a Might Edge
of 1 and a Speed Edge of 0, or you have a
Might Edge of 0 and a Speed Edge of 1.
Either way, you have an Intellect Edge of 0.}

\itemLine{Cypher Use}{You can bear two cyphers at a time.}

\itemLine{All weapon proficiency}{You can use any non-Lightsaber weapon.\enabler}

\itemLine{Starting Equipment}{Appropriate clothing, two weapons of your choice, one expensive item, two moderately priced items, and up to four inexpensive items}

\itemLine{Special Abilities}{Pick four from the abilities described below. Some special abilities are constant, ongoing effects, and others are specific actions that usually cost points from one of your stat Pools. You cannot choose the same ability more than once unless specified otherwise.}

\itemAbility{Bash (1 Might point)}{This is a pummeling melee attack. Your attack inflicts 1 less point of damage than normal, but dazes your target for one round, during which time the difficulty of all tasks it performs is modified by one step to its detriment.\action}

\itemAbility{Control the Field (1 Might point)}{This melee attack inflicts 1 less point of damage than normal, but regardless of whether you hit the target, you maneuver it into a position you desire within immediate range.\action}

\itemAbility{Extra Edge}{Your physical nature grants you an Edge of 1 in both Speed and Might, rather than one or the other.}

\itemAbility{Unarmed Fighter}{When you make an unarmed attack (such as a punch or kick), it counts as a medium weapon instead of a light weapon.\enabler}

\itemAbility{Overwatch (1 Intellect point)}{You use a ranged weapon to target a limited area (such as a doorway, a hallway) and make an attack against the next viable target to enter that area. This works like a wait action, but you also negate any benefit the target would have from cover, position, surprise, range, illumination, or visibility. Further, you inflict 1 additional point of damage with the attack. You can remain on Overwatch as long as you wish, within reason.\action}

\itemAbility{Physical Skill Training}{You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two of the following: \textit{climb, running, jump, swim}, or similar physical skills. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills.\enabler}

\itemAbility{Pierce (1 Speed point)}{This is a well-aimed, penetrating ranged attack. You make an attack and inflict 1 additional point of damage if your weapon has a sharp or energy-based point.\action}

\itemAbility{Armor Proficiency}{You can wear armor for long periods of time without tiring and can compensate for slowed reactions from wearing armor. You can wear any kind of armor. You reduce the Speed cost for wearing armor by 1. You start the game with a type of armor of your choice.\enabler}

\itemAbility{Tomahawk Toss (2 Speed points)}{After using a thrown light weapon, you draw another light weapon and make another thrown attack against the same target or a different one.\action}

\itemAbility{Weakening Strike (1 Speed point)}{This is a quick, agile melee attack. Your attack inflicts 1 less point of damage than normal but dazes your target for one round, during which time the difficulty of all tasks it performs is modified by one step to its detriment.\action}

\itemAbility{Thrust (1 Might point)}{This is a powerful melee stab. You make an attack and inflict 1 additional point of damage if your weapon has a sharp edge or point.\action}

\itemAbility{Dexterous Defense}{You are trained in Speed defense actions when not wearing armor.\enabler}

\subsubsection*{Second-Tier Soldier}
\label{subsub:soldierSecondTier}

Choose two of the abilities described below (or from a lower tier) to add to your repertoire. In addition, you can replace one of your lower-tier abilities with a different one from a lower tier.

\itemAbility{Power Strike (2 Might points)}{This is a heavy, powerful slice with a bladed weapon, probably overhand. You must grip your weapon with two hands to chop. When making this attack, you take a –1 penalty to the attack roll, and you inflict 3 additional points of damage.\action}

\itemAbility{Crush (2 Might points)}{This is a powerful pummeling attack with a bashing weapon, probably overhand. You must grip your weapon with two hands to crush. (If fighting unarmed, this attack is made with both fists or both feet together.) When making this attack, you take a –1 penalty to the attack roll, and you inflict 3 additional points of damage.\action}

\itemAbility{Mighty Blow (2 Might points)}{You strike two foes with a single blow. Make separate attack rolls for each foe, but both attacks count as a single action in a single round. You remain limited by the amount of Effort you can apply on one action. Anything that modifies your attack or damage applies to both of these attacks.\action}

\itemAbility{Reload (1 Speed point)}{When using a weapon that normally requires an action to reload, such as a heavy blaster rifle, you can reload and fire (or fire and reload) in the same action.\enabler}

\itemAbility{Weapon Training}{Choose one type of attack in which you are not already trained: \textit{light bashing, light bladed, light ranged, medium bashing, medium bladed, medium ranged, heavy bashing, heavy bladed, heavy ranged}. You are trained in attacks using that type of weapon. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose a different type of attack.\enabler}

\itemAbility{Defense Training}{Choose one type of defense task in which you are not already trained: \textit{Might, Speed, Intellect.} You are trained in \emph{defense tasks} of that type. You can select this ability up to three times. Each time you select it, you must choose a different type of defense task.\enabler}

\itemAbility{Kill Zone (2 Speed points)}{If you take down a foe, you can immediately make another attack on that same turn against a new foe within your reach. The second attack is part of the same action. You can use this ability with melee attacks and ranged attacks.\enabler}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% SOLDIER TIER 3
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection*{Third-Tier Soldier}
\label{subsub:soldierThirdTier}

Choose three of the abilities described below (or from a lower tier) to add to your repertoire. In addition, you can replace one of your lower-tier abilities with a different one from a lower tier.

\itemAbility{Deadly Aim (3 Speed points)}{For the next minute, all ranged attacks you make inflict 2 additional points of damage.\actionInit}

\itemAbility{Armor Expertise}{The cost reduction from your Armor Proficiency ability improves. You now reduce the Speed cost for wearing armor by 2. Must have \textit{Armor Proficiency} to benefit from this ability.\enabler}

\itemAbility{Expert Cypher Use}{You can bear three cyphers at a time.\enabler}

\itemAbility{Reaper (3 Might points)}{For the next minute, all melee attacks you make inflict 2 additional points of damage.\actionInit}

\itemAbility{Lunge (2 Might points)}{This ability requires you to extend yourself for a powerful stab or smash. The awkward lunge increases the difficulty of the attack roll by one step. If your attack is successful, it inflicts 4 additional points of damage.\action}

\itemAbility{Close Combat Specialist}{If a creature you attacked on your last turn with a melee attack uses its action to move out of immediate range, you gain an action to attack the creature as a parting blow, even if you have already taken a turn in the round.\enabler}

\itemAbility{Seize the Moment (4+ Speed points)}{If you succeed on a Speed defense roll to resist an attack, you gain an action. You can use the action immediately even if you have already taken a turn in the round. You don’t take an action during the next round, unless you apply a level of Effort when you use Seize the Moment.\enabler}

\itemAbility{Slice 'n Dice (2 Speed points)}{This is a quick attack with a bladed or pointed weapon that is hard to defend against. The difficulty of the attack roll is decreased by one step. If the attack is successful, it deals 1 less point of damage than normal.\action}

\itemAbility{Rapid Fire (2 Speed points)}{If a weapon has the ability to fire rapid shots without reloading (usually called a rapid-fire weapon, such as a repeater blaster), you can spray multiple shots around your target to increase the chance of hitting.

\subsection{Scout} % (fold)
\label{sub:scout}

Scouts are natural explorers and adventurers, full of curiosity and trained to handle out-of-the-way locations where they often operate. Scouts tend to be independent, signing on when the credits are good and their skills are best utilized and tested. Scouts understand the lay of the land and the orbit of the stars. They know how to recognize danger and locate basic necessities for survival. The scout seeks knowledge, tries to solve mysteries, and wants to be the first to see something new. The scout learns to find a path through the wild regions, often becoming a decent pilot along the way, and usually learns how to protect themselves from whatever hides over the next hill or beyond the most distant nebula.

Scouts temper insatiable curiosity with excellent survival instincts. They make use of Speed and personal experience to spot and avoid dangers. The scout has an undying faith in themselves and their abilities that sometimes allows the scout to call upon reserves and inner strength to get out of tough situations. Scouts like to be the first to reach any location, although they also want to reach it in one piece. They can be gruff or silent, jovial or talkative. They are confident and brave, and they often appreciate the wonders that the galaxy has to offer.

\subsubsection*{Characteristics}
\label{subsub:scoutCharacteristics}

Scouts come to their profession in search of something, usually knowledge or secrets or answers to the mysteries of the ages. Scholars, while possibly associated with and institute of learning or particular government, often forsake the halls of academia for the pure research of working in the field. Pathfinders and explorers may work for a government or military institutions, or freelance contracts from anyone willing to pay for their services. Many scouts develop into bounty hunters, especially those who combine military skills with their tracking and searching abilities. Every group of adventurers benefit from having a scout in the party.

\itemLine{Individual Role}{Although scouts can be academics or well studied, they are first and foremost interested in action. They face grave dangers and terrible obstacles as a routine part of life.}

\itemLine{Group Role}{Scouts sometimes work alone, but far more often they operate in teams with other characters. The scout frequently leads the way, blazing the trail. However, they also likely to stop and investigate anything intriguing they stumble upon.}

\itemLine{Societal Role}{Scouts are remarkable in that they can do so many different things, and some do multiple things. Skilled and learned scouts who share their achievements with others are prized members of society, well respected for what they know and can do.}

\itemLine{Advanced Scouts}{Higher-tier scouts gain more skills, some combat abilities, and a number of abilities that allow them to deal with danger. In short, they become more and more well-rounded, able to deal with any challenge.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Scoundrel} % (fold)
\label{sub:scoundrel}

Scoundrels are rogues--good, bad, and neutral--who either live outside the law or manipulates it to suit their needs. They can come from any world or region in the Galaxy. Most use their Intelligence and attention to detail to accomplish tasks, and many rely on their silver-tongue when all else fails. The scoundrel gets by with bravado, dunning, duplicity, and trickery. They live by their wits, manipulating others, but can fight when the need arises.

Many scoundrels live a life of adventure for the excitement it provides. Others go adventuring to advance their illicit careers. Some are good-hearted rogues in it for the thrill or to right a wrong done to them or those they love. Others are despicable knaves who serve only one master--the greed that swells inside them. Most often, an adventurous scoundrel falls somewhere in-between, changing allegiance and attitude as the political climate changes. The skills a scoundrel pick up along the way make them great members of any mission team.

\subsubsection*{Characteristics}
\label{subsub:scoundrelCharacteristics}

Scoundrels have a knack for getting out of trouble. They have an instinct for self-preservation that keeps them alive, but it's usually tempered with a need to experience thrills that their profession has to offer, and many adventurous scoundrels are also saddle with a sense of honour that sometimes makes them go against their natural inclinations.

\itemLine{Individual Role}{Scoundrels are smart and charismatic. They like people and, more important, they understand them. This helps scoundrels get others to do what needs
to be done.}

\itemLine{Group Role}{The scoundrel is often the face of the group, serving as the person who speaks for all and negotiates with others. Combat and action are not a scoundrel's immediate resolve, so other characters sometimes have to defend the speaker in times of danger.}

\itemLine{Societal Role}{Scoundrels are viewed from a myriad of different opinions throughout the Galaxy. One the one hand, law-abiding citizens see them as thugs, deviants, and con-artists--living only for themselves and their pocket. On the other, mercenaries and crime lord see them as a valuable and disposable asset to suit their needs. Scoundrels view other scoundrels with a variable degree of respect based on their achievements; many scoundrels achieve memorable moments in Galactic history to use as bragging rights to their peers and potential marks. Either way, scoundrels are an essential part of any functional society, since they are more willing to do high-risk tasks--for the right price.}

\itemLine{Advanced Scoundrels}{Higher-tier scoundrels use their persuasion skills to control and manipulate people as well as aid their friends. They can talk their way out of danger and back up intimidation with impressive displays of blaster gun-play. Their connections with the black-market splicers make them a dangerous foe for droids.}

Choose two of the following: \textit{deception, persuasion, public speaking, detect deception, intimidation}, or a similar interaction skill. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills.\enabler}

\itemAbility{Light \& Medium Weapon Proficiency}{You can use light and medium weapons without penalty. If you wield a heavy weapon, increase the difficulty of the attack by one step.\enabler}

\itemAbility{Spin Identity (2+ Intellect points)}{You convince all intelligent creatures who can see, hear, and understand you that you are someone or something other than who you actually are. You don’t impersonate a specific individual known to the victim. Instead, you convince the victim that you are someone they do not know belonging to a certain category of people. “We’re from the government.” “I’m just a simple farmer from the next town over.” “Your commander sent me.” A disguise isn’t necessary, but a good disguise will almost certainly be an asset to the roll involved. If you attempt to convince more than one creature, the Intellect cost increases by 1 point per additional victim. Fooled creatures remain so for up to an hour, unless your actions or other circumstances reveal your true identity earlier.\action}

\itemAbility{Terrifying Presence (2+ Intellect points)}{ You convince one intelligent target of level 3 or lower that you are its worst nightmare. The target must be within short range and be able to understand you. For as long as you do nothing but speak (you can’t even move), the target is paralyzed with fear, runs away, or takes some other action appropriate to the circumstances. Instead of applying Effort to decrease the difficulty of the roll, you can apply Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to terrorize a level 5 target (two levels above the normal limit), you must apply two levels of Effort.\action}

\itemAbility{Understanding (2 Intellect points)}{You observe or study a creature or object. The next time you interact with it, the difficulty of the related task is reduced by one step.\action}

\subsubsection*{Second-Tier Scoundrel}
\label{subsub:scoundrelSecondTier}

Choose two of the abilities described below (or from a lower tier) to add to your repertoire. In addition, you can replace one of your lower-tier abilities with a different one from a lower tier.

\itemAbility{Babel}{After hearing a language spoken for a few minutes, you can speak it and make yourself understood. If you continue to use the language to interact with native speakers, your skills improve rapidly, to the point where you might be mistaken for a native speaker after just a few hours of speaking the new language.\enabler}

\itemAbility{Impersonate (2 Intellect points)}{You alter your voice, posture, and mannerisms, whip together a disguise, and gain an asset on an attempt to impersonate someone else, whether it is a specific individual or a general role.\actionInit}

\itemAbility{Armor Proficiency}{You can wear armor for long periods of time without tiring and can compensate for slowed reactions from wearing armor. You can wear any kind of armor. You reduce the Speed cost for wearing armor by 1. You start the game with armor of your choice.\enabler}

\itemAbility{Skill Training}{You are trained in one task of your choosing (other than attacks or defense). If you choose a task you’re already trained in, you become specialized in that task. You can’t choose a task you’re already specialized in.\enabler}

\itemAbility{Unlicensed Medical Advice (3 Intellect points)}{Your experience in personal injury treatment is shared vocally to character within short range that can understand you. When they make a recovery roll, they must spend only half the normal amount of time required to do so (minimum one action).\action}

\itemAbility{Unexpected Betrayal}{Within a round or two of successfully using Enthrall, Fast Talk, or a similar ability on a target within short range, the difficulty of the first attack you make on that target is decreased by two steps. Once you use Unexpected Betrayal on a target, the difficulty of using your abilities or attempting simple persuasion on that target is permanently increased by two steps.\enabler.}

\subsubsection*{Third-Tier Scoundrel}
\label{subsub:scoundrelThirdTier}

Choose three of the abilities described below (or from a lower tier) to add to your repertoire. In addition, you can replace one of your lower-tier abilities with a different one from a lower tier.

\itemAbility{Hurry Up! (4+ Intellect points)}{Your words imbue a character within immediate range who is able to understand you, accelerating them so that they gain an asset on initiative tasks and Speed defense rolls for ten minutes. Instead of applying Effort to decrease the difficulty, you can use it to affect more targets; each level of Effort affects one additional target. You must speak to additional targets to accelerate them, one target per round. Action per target to initiate.\actionInitTarget}

\itemAbility{Blend In (4 Intellect points)}{When you blend in, creatures still see you, but they attach no importance to your presence for about a minute. While blending in, you are specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if you do something to reveal your presence or position-- attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, you can regain the remaining period of effect by taking an action to focus on seeming innocuous and as if you belong.\actionInit}

\itemAbility{Discerning Mind}{You have +3 to Armor against damaging attacks and damaging effects that target your mind and Intellect. The difficulty of defense rolls you make against attacks that attempt to confuse, persuade, frighten, or otherwise influence you is decreased by one step.\enabler}

\itemAbility{Expert Cypher Use}{You can bear three cyphers at a time.}

\itemAbility{Grand Deception (3 Intellect points)}{You convince an intelligent creature that can understand you and isn’t hostile of something that is wildly and obviously untrue.\action}

\itemAbility{Haywire Intrusion (4 Intellect points)}{ Your sneaky data pad device is able to intrude the memory of a droid within a short range, even if it doesn’t want you to. You must be able to see the target. Once you have established contact, you can read the target’s memory command for up to one minute. If you or the target moves out of range, the connection is broken.\actionInit}

\itemAbility{Oratory (4 Intellect points)}{When speaking with a group of intelligent creatures that can understand you and aren’t hostile, you convince them to take one reasonable action in the next round. A reasonable action must be agreed upon by the GM; it should not put the creatures or their allies in obvious danger or be wildly out of character.\action}

\itemAbility{Telling (2 Intellect points)}{This ability provides an asset to any tasks attempting to deceive, persuade, or intimidate. Each use lasts up to a minute; a new use (to switch tasks) replaces the previous use.\actionInit}

\subsubsection*{Fourth-Tier Scoundrel}
\label{subsub:scoundrelFourthTier}

Choose two of the abilities described below (or from a lower tier) to add to your repertoire. In addition, you can replace one of your lower-tier abilities with a different one from a lower tier.

\itemAbility{Anticipate Attack (4 Intellect points)}{You can sense when and how creatures attacking you will make their attacks. The difficulty of Speed defense rolls is reduced by one step for one minute.\action}

\itemAbility{Confounding Banter (4 Intellect points)}{You spew a stream of nonsense to distract a foe within immediate range. On a successful Intellect roll, the difficulty of your defense roll against the creature’s next attack before the end of the next round is reduced by one step.\action}

\itemAbility{Deceptive Strike (2 Speed points)}{If you spend one action creating a misdirection or diversion, in the next round you can take advantage of your opponent’s lowered defenses. Make a melee attack roll against that opponent. The difficulty of the roll is decreased by one step. If your attack is successful, it inflicts 4 additional points of damage.\action}

\itemAbility{Heightened Skills}{You are trained in two tasks of your choosing (other than attacks or defense). If you choose a task you’re already trained in, you instead become specialized in that task. You can’t choose a task you’re already specialized in.}

\itemAbility{Nerve Strike (4 Intellect points)}{Upon discovering a potential weak-spot in a creature's nervous system you attack with pinpoint accuracy, dealing 6 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) per round. The debilitation can be dispersed if a target spends an action doing nothing.\actionInit}

\itemAbility{Quick Wits}{When performing a task that would normally require spending points from your Intellect Pool, you can spend points from your Speed Pool instead.\enabler}

\itemAbility{Read the Signs (4 Intellect points)}{You examine an area and learn precise, useful details about the past (if any exist). You can ask the GM up to four questions about the immediate area; each requires its own roll. \action}

\itemAbility{Suggestion (4 Intellect points)}{You suggest an action to another creature (level 2 or lower) within immediate range. If the action doesn’t seem completely at odds with the creature’s nature, it follows your suggestion for up to a minute. Instead of applying Effort to decrease the difficulty, you can apply it to increase the maximum level of the target by 1. When the effect ends, the creature remembers following the suggestion, but believes that it chose to do so willingly. \actionInit}

\subsubsection*{Fifth-Tier Scoundrel}
\label{subsub:scoundrelFifthTier}

Choose three of the abilities described below (or from a lower tier) to add to your repertoire. In addition, you can replace one of your lower-tier abilities with a different one from a lower tier.

\itemAbility{Adroit Cypher Use}{You can bear four cyphers at a time.}

\itemAbility{Armor Expertise}{The cost reduction from your Armor Proficiency ability improves. You now reduce the Speed cost for wearing armor by 2. Must have \textit{Armor Proficiency} to benefit from this ability.\enabler}

\itemAbility{Flee (6 Intellect points)}{All non-allies within short distance who can hear your dreadful, intimidating words flee from you at top speed for one minute.}

\itemAbility{Scoundrel's Luck (4 Intelligence points)}{When you roll for a task and succeed, roll again. If the second number rolled is higher than the first, you get a minor effect. If you roll the same number again, you get a major effect. If you roll lower then nothing happens. \enabler}

\itemAbility{Jury-Rig (5 Intellect points)}{You quickly create an object using what would seem to be entirely inappropriate materials. You can make a bomb out of a tin can and household cleaners, a security spike out of scrapped droid parts, or a make-shift blaster out of some base components. The level of the item determines the difficulty of the task, but the appropriateness of the materials modifies it as well. Generally, the object can be no larger than something you can hold in one hand, and it functions once (or, in the case of a weapon or similar item, is essentially useful for one encounter). If you spend at least ten minutes on the task, you can create an item of level 5 or lower. You can’t change the nature of the materials involved. For example, you can’t take iron rods and make a pile of gold coins or a wicker basket.\action}

\itemAbility{Weapon Training}{Choose one type of attack in which you are not already trained: \textit{light bashing, light bladed, light ranged, medium bashing, medium bladed, medium ranged}. You are trained in attacks using that type of weapon. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose a different type of attack.\enabler}

\itemAbility{Stimulate (6 Intellect points)}{Your words encourage a target you touch who can understand you. The difficulty of the next action it takes is decreased by three steps.\action}

\subsubsection*{Sixth-Tier Scoundrel}
\label{subsub:scoundrelSixthTier}

Choose two of the abilities described below (or from a lower tier) to add to your repertoire. In addition, you can replace one of your lower-tier abilities with a different one from a lower tier.

\itemAbility{Battle Management (4 Intellect points)}{As long as you spend your action each round giving orders or advice, the difficulty of attack and defense actions by your allies within short range is decreased by one step.\action}

\itemAbility{Inspiring Success (6 Intellect points)}{When you succeed on a roll to perform a task related to the stat that you choose upon selecting this ability, and you applied at least one level of Effort, you may choose another character within short range. That PC has an asset on the next task they attempt using that stat on her next turn.\enabler}

\itemAbility{Dangerous Showdown (7+ Intellect points)}{Your knowledge in creature anatomy, coupled with the quick draw of your trusty blaster allows you to deliver a paralytic ranged attack to every intelligent level 1 target within short range that can understand you. This deadly attack reduces each target to a vegetative state. Instead of applying Effort to decrease the difficulty of the attack, you can apply Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to pinpoint the weak-spot of a level 5 target (four levels above the normal limit), you must apply four levels of Effort.\action}

\itemAbility{Scoundrel's Awareness}{Years alone in the Galaxy has conditioned you to identify trouble and deception. You recognize holograms, disguises, optical illusions, sound mimicry, and other such tricks (for all senses) for what they are.\action}

\itemAbility{Haywire Override (8 Intellect points)}{ Through the use of a black-market droid override spike, you are able to control the functions of any machine, intelligent or otherwise. You must touch the machine to insert the spike, but afterward, there is no range limitation. This effect lasts for one week. You can master only one machine at a time.\actionInit}
